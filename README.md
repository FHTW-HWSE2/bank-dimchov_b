This is a simple console-based banking application.

When the program is running, a clear menu will be printed using the print_help() function. This function displays all available options so the user can interact with the system easily.

When executed, the following options will appear:

*** WELCOME TO THE BANK ***
Select an option:
 1.   Create an account
 2.   Delete account
 3.   Deposit money
 4.   Withdraw money
 5.   Transfer money
 6.   Report
 7.   Simulate 7 days
 8.   Exit

Each number corresponds to a specific action you can perform in the banking system. This menu will help guide the user through the available features every time it's printed.
